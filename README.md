# Water Level Monitoring
 - The water level monitoring system was designed and tested to automatically maintain water levels in a tank between present empty and full thresholds. An ultrasonic sensor measured the real-time water level percentage, displaying it on an LCD screen. When the level dropped below the empty threshold, the system activated a submersible pump to refill the tank. Upon reaching the full threshold, the pump was automatically shut off. The system components including the LCD, buzzer, LED indicators, relay module, and ultrasonic sensor were properly integrated to enable the reliable functionality of monitoring the water level and controlling the pump. The results demonstrated that the system successfully maintained the desired water level through the automated control logic.
# Hardware Tools Used:
  - ATMEGA328P-PU
  - Ultrasonic Sensor
  - LED
  - Buzzer
  - 12V Power Adapter
  - 9V Battery
  - Jumper Wire
  - I2C LCD Display
  - Water Pump
  - Relay Module
  - PCB
# How it Works
- When the tank is full, the LED will turn on. When the tank is empty, it will trigger an alarm, turn on the LED, and activate the water pump.
